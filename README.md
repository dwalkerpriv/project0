Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I created this site as a semi "about me" microsite. I looked into how to create a nav bar
as well as other styling aspects that weren't cover in the first 2 video courses.

I had a problem centering the background image and sizing it down as the screen got smaller while still centered. Didn't figure it out so I left it as is.

Overall, I think this was a decent first attempt at creating a website in an old fashioned
kinda way.

Looking forward to learning more.
